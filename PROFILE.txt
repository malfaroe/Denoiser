Objective: implement an audio file denoiser
Operation: using an noised audio file as an input, the system will
output a cleaned/denoised audio file
Techniques: VAE with convolutional layers
Data for training: tbd
Implementation time:tbd
Stages:
1. Review of related projects, final design and objectives refinement/precision
------https://github.com/vbelz/Speech-enhancement
2. General design and stages outline
3. Methods and general script
4. Coding, implementation and static fire testing
5. Model Training
6. Testing
7. Operation/production



#####RANDOM NOISE UNIT
Issues:
- Librosa takes too long to load (does it happen in mac also?)
- Low quality of reconstructed files---> SOLVED
- Code must be refactored and renamed

###RECONSTRUCION TESTING UNIT ---DONE
- Take one file and convert to spec DONE
- Separate into magnitud and phase DONE
- reconstruct the file DONE
- test reconstrucion quality DONE
- Once completed: incorporate to random noise unit DONE


####NEXT STAGE: CREATING NOISY DATA WITH REAL NOISES
- Code/designs survey
- First testing unit:
   1. EXTRACT voice and noise and convert to numpy (load)
   2. BLEND some clean voices with randiom selected NOISES
   3.
